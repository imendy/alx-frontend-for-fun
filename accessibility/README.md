# Web Accessibility Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our Web Accessibility Guide! This guide provides comprehensive information about Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Accessibility Conformance Levels, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), accessibility testing tools, screen readers, keyboard navigation, and skip links.

## WCAG Timeline

- 1999: WCAG 1.0 released by W3C
- 2008: WCAG 2.0 (current version) released
- 2012: WCAG 2.0 became ISO standard
- 2017: WCAG 2.1 draft under public review
- 2018: WCAG 2.1 became ISO standard
- 2020: WCAG 2.2 working draft and WCAG 3.0 ("Silver") in working phase

## Principles (POUR)

WCAG is organized around four principles, often called by the acronym POUR:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

## Accessibility Levels

WCAG defines three different levels:

- Level A (required)
- Level AA (required)
- Level AAA (optional)

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- Use native HTML elements whenever possible.
- ARIA provides extra information to assistive technologies.
- Be cautious not to misuse ARIA as a quick fix.

## Accessibility Testing Tools

Differentiate between automated tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) and manual tools (e.g., screen readers, code analysis).
Prominent companies in accessibility include Siteimprove, Tenon.io, Deque, and The Paciello Group.

## Screen Readers

- VoiceOver (Apple)
- Jaws (expensive)
- NVDA (open source alternative to Jaws)
- Basic shortcuts provided for VoiceOver (Mac OSX).

## Keyboard Navigation

- Some users rely solely on keyboard navigation.
- Ensure proper tabbing order and skip links.

## Skip Links

- Facilitate keyboard navigation with skip links.
- WCAG 2.1: "A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages."
